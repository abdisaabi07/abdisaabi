  <h2> History </h2>
  <p> Ethiopian athletics has a long and storied history dating back to ancient times. The country is known for producing some of the world's greatest long-distance runners, including Haile Gebrselassie and Kenenisa Bekele. </p>
  <p> In recent years, Ethiopia has also become a force in middle-distance and sprint events. The country's success can be attributed to a number of factors, including a high-altitude training environment and a culture that values athleticism and hard work. </p>
